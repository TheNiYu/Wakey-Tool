# 🖱️ Wakey Wakey – by TheNiYu

A lightweight utility that keeps your PC and all the "active" dependencies awake.

This tool fakes user activity by moving the mouse and pressing `CTRL` at regular intervals so your system doesn’t lock you out.

## ⚙️ What it does

- 🟢 Keeps you “Active” 
- 🖱️ Moves the mouse slightly (customizable pixels)
- ⌨️ Presses the `CTRL` key silently
- 🔒 Prevents Windows standby and screen lock
- 🖼️ Simple, intuitive interface – no coding required
- ✅ No installation needed – just run the `.exe`

---

## 🚀 How to use

1. Download `Wakey.exe` from the [Releases](../../releases) section
2. Run it (no installation needed)
3. Set your preferred:
   - Interval (in seconds)
   - Mouse movement (in pixels)
4. Click **Start**
5. Leave it running in the background

**That’s it.** You can now wait, work, or whatever without going idle.

## 🔐 File Integrity (SHA256)

To verify that the executable has not been modified, you can check its SHA256 hash.

**`Wakey.exe` SHA256 checksum:**
2eea0488144a5dbbd48f104eec70cf690599149a18a57789e5dd4251ac69ca31

### 🧪 How to verify it on Windows

Open Command Prompt in the same folder as the file and run:
CertUtil -hashfile Wakey.exe SHA256

If the hash matches, you're good to go 👍
